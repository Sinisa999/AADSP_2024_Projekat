/** @name  Wavefile support
 *
 * When running code in the simulator, there is support to load/write a PCM wave file
 * as defined in dsplib/wavefile.h.  The wave functions are implemented as special hooks in the single core simulator
 * and are thus not available when running on an actual hardware DSP platform.
 *
 * Below is an example on how to read in a wave file:
 *
 * @code
 * #include <stdio.h>
 * #include <dsplib\wavefile.h>
 * int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 * {
 *    WAVREAD_HANDLE *handle;
 *    int nChannels;
 *    int bitsPerFrame;
 *    int sampleRate;
 *    int numberOfFrames;
 *    int sample;
 *    int i;
 *    handle = cl_wavread_open("f:\\11k16bitpcm.wav");
 *
 *    if(handle == NULL)
 *    {
 *        printf("Unable to open file\n");
 *        return -1;
 *    }
 *
 *    nChannels = cl_wavread_getnchannels(handle);
 *    bitsPerFrame = cl_wavread_bits_per_sample(handle);
 *    sampleRate = cl_wavread_frame_rate(handle);
 *    numberOfFrames =  cl_wavread_number_of_frames(handle);
 *
 *    for(i = 0; i< numberOfFrames *nChannels ; i++)
 *    {
 *        sample = cl_wavread_recvsample(handle);
 *    }
 *
 *    cl_wavread_close(handle);
 *    return 0;
 * }
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * Below is an example on how to write an 11Khz, 16bit mono wav file:
 *
 * @code
 * #include <stdio.h>
 * #include <stdfix.h>
 * #include <dsplib\wavefile.h>
 * #include <dsplib\dsp_math.h>
 *
 * int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 * {
 *     WAVWRITE_HANDLE * handle;
 *     int         i;
 *     _Accum      a = 0;
 *     _Accum      b = 0;
 *     int         temp;
 *
 *     // Open a 16 bit, mono, 11Khz wave file to be written.
 *     handle = cl_wavwrite_open("f:\\testfile2.wav", 16, 1, 11025);
 *     if(!handle)
 *     {
 *         printf("Error: Could not open wavefile.\n");
 *         return -1;
 *     }
 *
 *     for(i = 0 ; i < 100000; i++ )
 *     {
 *         a += (_Accum)(2.0 * 1000.0/ 11025.0);
 *         if(a > 1)
 *         {
 *             a-= 2;
 *         }
 *         b = cl_sin(a);
 *         temp= bitsr((_Fract) b);
 *         cl_wavwrite_sendsample(handle, temp);
 *     }
 *
 *     cl_wavwrite_close(handle);
 *     return 0;
 * }
 * @endcode
