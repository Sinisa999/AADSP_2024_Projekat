/**
 *  @brief The Module Call Table (MCT) is a table of framework entry points.
 *
 *  This table contains 8 optional entry points that may be called by
 *  the OS Framework.
 *
 *  @param framework_prekick_entry_point_t* <b>prekick_func_ptr</b>
 *  Unconditional initializations.
 *  Initialize vars whose values don't depend on MCV.
 *  This function gets called before the KickStart message is received and
 * acted-on. Called only when the OS re-boots.
 *
 *  @param framework_entry_point_t* <b>postkick_func_ptr</b>
 *  Unconditional initializations OR conditional initializations.
 *  This function gets called immediately after the KickStart message is
 * received and acted-on (i.e., prior to any other Framework Entry-point). This
 * function also gets called upon App-Restart (which happens after recovering
 * from an audio under-flow). This function gets called before any
 * block-processing functions are called. An example of the kind of
 * initialization that must happen here would be any filter state that must be
 * cleared prior to starting audio again.
 *
 *  @param framework_entry_point_t* <b>timer_func_ptr</b>
 *   Foreground function called less frequently than frame or block.
 *   Called from the Block ISR (a.k.a., Brick ISR or Foreground ISR)
 *   Called only when the Timer flag is set (gets set by the Timer ISR)
 *   Use this to act on MCV changes when the block and frame functions are not
 * being called
 *
 *  @param framework_entry_point_t* <b>frame_func_ptr</b>
 *   called on input frame boundaries..
 *   Called from the Block ISR (a.k.a., Brick ISR or Foreground ISR).
 *   This function gets called on frame boundaries (integer multiples of
 * sample-blocks)
 *     -#:  AAC Frame-size is 1024 samples.
 *     -#:  Our PCM frame-size was chosen to be 256 samples.
 *   Use this as another place to act on MCV changes.  This is called more often
 * than the Timer functions, but is only called when the DAO clocks are active
 * (only an issue with Decoder chips).
 *
 *  @param framework_entry_point_t* <b>block_func_ptr</b>
 *   Called once for each brick (16 samples) of PCM input.
 *   Called from the Block ISR (a.k.a., Brick ISR or Foreground ISR) whenever
 * there is one or more blocks of unprocessed PCM in the IO Buffer. This
 * function can process only one block of any channel, but all channels are
 * available. This function is inherently an in-place processor. There is an
 * array of I/O buffer pointers, located at YMEM addresses 0x60 - 0x6F. These
 * pointers will point at block N for all channels.
 *
 *  @param 	void* <b>reserved1</b>
 *
 *  @param bg_framework_entry_point_t* <b>background_func_ptr</b>
 *  Perform interruptible, lower priority processing.
 *  Called from an infinite-loop in the main body of the OS code.
 *  Can be interrupted, so exercise caution when using global vars that are used
 * in the foreground ISR.
 *
 *  @param framework_entry_point_t* <b>postmalloc_func_ptr</b>
 *  Called after successful malloc by all modules in system.
 *  Called from the Block ISR (a.k.a., Brick ISR or Foreground ISR).
 *  Called if the mallocations requested by the modules' Pre-Mallocs succeeds.
 *  This gives the module designer a chance to act upon the newly acquired
 * buffers if so desired.  For example, a malloced FIR-filter history-buffer
 * should be cleared here. This function is also a good place to set a
 * malloc-success flag for the benefit of the Block function.  That is, the
 * Block function should never try to operate on a buffer that has not yet been
 * malloc'ed.
 *
 *  @param framework_entry_point_t* <b>premalloc_func_ptr</b>
 *   Request memory from the heap.
 *   Called from the Block ISR (a.k.a., Brick ISR or Foreground ISR).
 *   Called immediately after the frame functions are called and immediately
 * prior to the PostMalloc functions. This function is only called if one or
 * more modules set the X_VX_NextFrm_Reinit_Req flag (in the Frame function).
 *   When this happens, all modules' PreMalloc functions get called so that each
 * module has the chance to ask for heap memory. If this function gets called,
 * the OS has already freed all of the heap, and all heap-using modules MUST
 * request heap again. There are 6 types of malloc requests: X, Y, L modulo and
 * non-modulo. Mallocation is all or nothing.  If there is not enough available
 * heap to accommodate the entire set of requests, the systems halts. If the
 * Malloc succeeds, the OS calls the Post Malloc functions.
